        <li>What is a version control system?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>"tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together"</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What is Git?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>"Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows"</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What is Github?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>"GitHub, Inc. is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control using Git. It provides the distributed version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project."</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What is the difference between Git and GitHub?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>"Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories"</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Who started Github and how was it started?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>"The GitHub service was developed by Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon using Ruby on Rails, and started in February 2008."</li>
                <li>"Wanstrath and Preston-Werner needed GitHub for their own work, and so they developed their tool out of necessity."</li>
            </ul>
        <li>What company owns it now?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Microsoft</li>

                <li>Basics for individuals and organizations: Free</li>
                <li>Team - Advanced collaboration for individuals and organizations: $44</li>
                <li>Enterprise - Security, compliance, and flexible deployment: $231</li>
            </ul>

    <h1>Git/GitHub Terms</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>repository: t is a directory that stores all of the files and folders you used to build the project and it also stores the changes made to the project.</li>
        <li>commit: commit is a change that you bring to your program, it can be adding, removing, modifying code or files from your project.</li>
        <li>fork: A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.</li>
        <li>push: push changes from local to remote</li>
        <li>pull requests: it is simply a way of telling people that you want the changes you made in the branch to get included in Main Code.</li>
        <li>workflows: GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects that deploy regularly.</li>
        <li>issues: Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens.</li>
        <li>raw button: raw view, you can view or copy the raw content of a file without any styling</li>
        <li>blame button: is used to examine the contents of a file line by line and see when each line was last modified and who the author of the modifications was.</li>
