        <h2>Student: Christopher Hoon</h2>

        <h2>Von Nuemann computer architecture, 4 major subsystems:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Memory</li>
            <li>Input/Output</li>
            <li>ALU</li>
            <li>Control Unit</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Von Nuemann Computer Architecture, 3 characteristics</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Single, shared memory for programs and data</li>
            <li>a single bus for memory access</li>
            <li>an arithmetic unit, and a program control unit</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Computer Architecture Terms</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>RAM: Random-access memory is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.</li>
            <li>cache: In computing, a cache is a hardware or software component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Principle of locality: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>locality of reference, also known as the principle of locality, is the tendency of a processor to access the same set of memory locations repetitively over a short period of time. There are two basic types of reference locality – temporal and spatial locality.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>ROM: Read-only memory is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM cannot be electronically modified after the manufacture of the memory device</li>
            <li>memory cell size: Memory cells can be of different sizes: 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, 64 bits. Different sized cells are used to store different types of data. A cell of 8 bits is called a byte. An integer is a whole number. An integer is generally stored in 4 bytes, or 32 bits.</li>
            <li>memory cell address: What Does Memory Address Mean? A memory address is a unique identifier used by a device or CPU for data tracking. This binary address is defined by an ordered and finite sequence allowing the CPU to track the location of each memory byte.</li>
            <li>maximum memory size: The max memory size is the maximum total RAM that the processor will address</li>
            <li>register:  processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's processor. Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage, although some registers have specific hardware functions, and may be read-only or write-only.</li>
            <li>fetch: Fetch is the retrieval of data by a software program, script, or hardware device</li>
            <li>store: the action of saving information for later use. With computers, you store information on a storage device, such as an internal hard drive, optical disc drive, or an external storage device</li>
            <li>memory access time: In computer science, Average Memory Access Time is a common metric to analyze computer memory system performance</li>
            <li>DASD: Direct access storage devices (DASDs) are fixed or removable storage devices. Typically, these devices are rotating disk drives or solid state disks. A fixed storage device is any storage device defined during system configuration to be an integral part of the system DASD.</li>
            <li>ALU: What is an arithmetic-logic unit (ALU)? An arithmetic-logic unit is the part of a central processing unit that carries out arithmetic and logic operations on the operands in computer instruction words.</li>
            <li>Control Unit: A control unit, or CU, is circuitry within a computer's processor that directs operations. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Four things the interface between the computer and the hardware does</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>file management</li>
            <li>memory management</li>
            <li>process management</li>
            <li>handling input and output</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Responsibilities of systems software:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>verifying data</li>
            <li>hangling bugs</li>
            <li>processor requests</li>
            <li>installations of updates</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Terms</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>system software: System software is software designed to provide a platform for other software. Examples of system software include operating systems like macOS, Linux, Android and Microsoft Windows, computational science software, game engines, search engines, industrial automation, and software as a service applications</li>
            <li>user interface: In the industrial design field of human–computer interaction, a user interface is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur.</li>
            <li>language services: he range of services used and/or required to facilitate communication and promote understanding amongst speakers of different languages, including (but not limited to) interpretation and translation services.</li>
            <li>memory managers: Memory management is a form of resource management applied to computer memory. The essential requirement of memory management is to provide ways to dynamically allocate portions of memory to programs at their request, and free it for reuse when no longer needed.</li>
            <li>information managers: primarily concerned with the capture, digitization, representation, organization, transformation, and presentation of information</li>
            <li>i/o managers: The I/O manager is the heart of the I/O system. It connects applications and system components to virtual, logical, and physical devices, and it defines the infrastructure that supports device drivers. A device driver typically provides an I/O interface for a particular type of device.</li>
            <li>scheduler: A scheduler is a software product that allows an enterprise to schedule and track computer batch tasks.</li>
            <li>utilities: a service provisioning model that offers computing resources such as hardware, software, and network bandwidth to clients as and when they require them on an on-demand basis</li>
            <li>assembly language: a type of low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Functions of an Operating System</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. It performs basic tasks such as file, memory and process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.</li>
        </ol>
