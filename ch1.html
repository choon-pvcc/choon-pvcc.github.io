        <h1>Chapter 1: An Introduction to Computer Science</h1>
        <h2>Student: Christopher Hoon</h2>

        <h2>Three misconceptions about Computer Science:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Myth 1 - Computer Science is the subject area that studies “Computers”</li>
            <li>Myth 2 - Computer Science is a science subject and is nothing useful to people working in non-science disciplines</li>
            <li>Myth 3 - Computer Science is only suitable for science students as it requires a strong background in Mathematics.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Briefly define:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Computer Science: The study of the principles and use of computers</li>
            <li>algorithm: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.</li>
            <li>sequential operation: the sequential execution of operations one after another</li>
            <li>conditional operation: used to evaluate a condition that's applied to one or two boolean expressions.</li>
            <li>iterative operation: a process where the design of a product or application is improved by repeated review and testing</li>
            <li>stored program computer: a computer that stores program instructions in electronically or optically accessible memory.</li>
            <li>integrated circuit: an electronic circuit formed on a small piece of semiconducting material, performing the same function as a larger circuit made from discrete components.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Briefly describe these computer generations:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First generation computer: 1946-1959 Used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry</li>
            <li>Second generation computer: 1959-1965 The second generation of computers consists of two types of devices, transistors, and magnetic core</li>
            <li>Third generation computer: computers that emerged due to the development of the integrated circuit (IC)</li>
            <li>Fourth generation computer: 1971-1980 These computers used the VLSI technology or the Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits technology.</li>
            <li>Fifth generation computer: The Fifth Generation Computer Systems was a 10-year initiative begun in 1982 by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry to create computers using massively parallel computing and logic programming</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>FORTRAN:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What does the acronym FORTRAN stand for? -> Formula Translation</li>
            <li>When was FORTRAN developed? -> 1954</li>
            <li>What was it used for? used for such projects as the design of bridges and aeroplane structures, it is used for factory automation control, for storm drainage design, analysis of scientific data and so on</li>
            <li>Is FORTRAN still being used today? If so, what for? It still is in use today; for doppler radar weather forecasts and more</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>COBOL:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What does the acronym COBOL stand for? -> Common Business Oriented Language</li>
            <li>When was COBOL developed? -> 1959</li>
            <li>What was it used for? It was designed for business computer programs in industries such as finance and human resources.</li>
            <li>Is COBOL still being used today? If so, what for? It still is in use today; in insurance, finance, and the public sector.</li>
        </ol>
