        <h2>Student: Christopher Hoon</h2>

        <h2>Chapter 2: Algorithms</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Explain why natural language is not an effective tool for describing algorithms</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>requires clarification dialogue.</li>
                    <li>may require more keystrokes.</li>
                    <li>may not show context.</li>
                    <li>is unpredictable.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Problem 1: A student has three grades. The final grade is the average of the three. List the algorithmic steps to find the final grade.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>add the grades</li>
                    <li>divide the result above by 3</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Problem 2: A car owner recorded the car's previous car mileage, current mileage, and the number of gallons of gas the owner filled their tank with. List the algorithmic steps to find the car's mpg (miles per gallon).</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>subtract current mileage from previous car mileage</li>
                    <li>divide result above by number of gallons</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

        <h2>Briefly define:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>natural language: a language that has developed naturally in use (as contrasted with an artificial language or computer code).</li>
            <li>pseudocode: a notation resembling a simplified programming language, used in program design</li>
            <li>sequential operation(straight-line algorithm): the sequential execution of operations one after another</li>
            <li>input: what is put in, taken in, or operated on by any process or system.</li>
            <li>output: a place where power or information leaves a system.</li>
            <li>conditional statement: In computer science, conditionals are programming language commands for handling decisions. Specifically, conditionals perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-defined boolean condition evaluates to true or false</li>
            <li>boolean condition: In computer science, a Boolean expression is an expression used in programming languages that produces a Boolean value when evaluated. A Boolean value is either true or false.</li>
            <li>algorithmic discovery process: a function that maps an event log onto a process model, such that the model is “representative” for the behavior seen in the event log</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Chapter 3: Briefly describe or define:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>why algorithms should be correct:  it always produces the expected output for the range of inputs and it eventually terminates</li>
            <li>why algorithms should be efficient: reducing the amount of iterations needed to complete your task in relation to the size of the dataset</li>
            <li>program maintenance: the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs</li>
            <li>importance of algorithm: ease of understanding - because humans will be maintaining the code.</li>
            <li>sequntial search algorithm: linear search, is a search algorithm implemented on lists</li>
            <li>order of magnitude: An order of magnitude is an approximation of the logarithm of a value relative to some contextually understood reference value, usually 10, interpreted as the base of the logarithm and the representative of values of magnitude one</li>
            <li>selection sort: In computer science, selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n²) time complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort</li>
            <li>flop (floating point operation): FLOPS are floating-point operations per second. Floating-point is, according to IBM, "a method of encoding real numbers within the limits of finite precision available on computers." Using floating-point encoding, extremely long numbers can be handled relatively easily.</li>
            <li>teraflop: a unit of computing speed equal to one million million (1012) floating-point operations per second.</li>
            <li>petaflop: a unit of computing speed equal to one thousand million million (1015) floating-point operations per second.</li>
            <li>parallel processor: Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time</li>
            <li>data cleanup problem: process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset.</li>
            <li>binary search algorithm: n computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array</li>
            <li>pattern matching: a technique where you test an expression to determine if it has certain characteristics</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Karl Friedrich Gauss</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Gauss’s first significant discovery, in 1792, was that a regular polygon of 17 sides can be constructed by ruler and compass alone. Its significance lies not in the result but in the proof, which rested on a profound analysis of the factorization of polynomial equations and opened the door to later ideas of Galois theory. His doctoral thesis of 1797 gave a proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra: every polynomial equation with real or complex coefficients has as many roots (solutions) as its degree (the highest power of the variable). Gauss’s proof, though not wholly convincing, was remarkable for its critique of earlier attempts. Gauss later gave three more proofs of this major result, the last on the 50th anniversary of the first, which shows the importance he attached to the topic.</p></li>
            <li><p>Gauss recognized he had fifty pairs of numbers when he added the first and last number in the series, the second and second-last number in the series, and so on. For example: (1 + 100), (2 + 99), (3 + 98), . . . , and each pair has a sum of 101.</p></li>
            <li><p>aussian optics is a technique in geometrical optics that describes the behaviour of light rays in optical systems by using the paraxial approximation, in which only rays which make small angles with the optical axis of the system are considered</p></li>
            <li><p>The Gaussian blur is a way to apply a low-pass filter in skimage. It is often used to remove Gaussian (i. e., random) noise from the image. For other kinds of noise, e.g. “salt and pepper”, a median filter is typically used.</p></li>
